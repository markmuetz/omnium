help=Packing accuracy codes.
    =These codes are used to control packing of data within fieldsfiles at

    =WGDOS packing profile 2 uses PC2 (Standard Climate output (OLD) )
    =WGDOS packing profile 4 uses PC4 (Stratosphere model output)
    =WGDOS packing profile 5 uses PC5 (Standard Climate packing)
    =GRIB packing uses PC6 (takes a positive value unlike the above WGDOS
    =packing schemes)
    =WGDOS packing profile 7 uses PC7 (Convective-scale i.e. <5km instantaneous
    =output) Profile 7 is appropriate for some of the more extreme values
    =generated when running a high resolution model. It also retains less 
    =accuracy on some fields to help reduce the output size of big high
    =resolution simulations.
    =PCn values are interpreted as follows:-
    =-99 outputs the fields in an unpacked state, irrespective of the chosen
    =packing profile.
    =For GRIB packing value indicates number of bits used.
    =WGDOS fields are packed to an absolute precision of 2^[PackCode].
    =The number is usually negative, so a packing code of -1 gives an accuracy
